# 🦷 AI-Driven Smart Dental Management System

### Multi-Channel Appointment Intelligence Platform using Conversational AI, Voice Agents & Computer Vision

----

## 📌 Overview

The *AI-Driven Smart Dental Management System* is an intelligent clinic automation platform designed to streamline dental appointment scheduling using *Conversational AI, Voice Assistants, and Computer Vision technologies*.

The system enables patients to schedule appointments through *three smart communication channels*:

* Website Chatbot Interface
* WhatsApp Conversational Agent
* AI Voice-Based Calling Assistant

Additionally, the platform integrates a *Dental X-Ray Image Analysis Module* for AI-assisted diagnostic support and is currently expanding with a *Decision Tree–based Patient No-Show Prediction Model* to optimize appointment attendance planning.

This project demonstrates the real-world application of *Artificial Intelligence in healthcare workflow automation and clinical decision support systems*.

----

# 🧠 Patient No-Show Prediction Module (In Progress)

The system is currently integrating a *Decision Tree Classification Model* to predict whether a patient is likely to miss a scheduled appointment.

This predictive analytics module will help clinics:

* reduce scheduling losses
* optimize appointment planning
* prioritize reminder notifications
* improve attendance prediction accuracy
* enhance clinic resource utilization

Algorithm Used:

Decision Tree Classifier

Implementation pipeline handled through:


extractor.py
schema.py
state.py
tools.py


The module is currently under testing and integration into the appointment workflow engine.

----

# 🔔 Smart Notification & Follow-Up System

Automated reminder and follow-up system improves appointment attendance efficiency.

Implemented using:


services/notification_service.py
email_service.py
follow_up_agent.py


Supports:

* appointment confirmation alerts
* reminder automation
* follow-up scheduling assistance
* attendance optimization messaging

----

# 📅 Google Calendar Integration

The system synchronizes appointments using secure Google Calendar OAuth integration.

Implemented using:


calendar_oauth.py


Features:

* automatic calendar booking
* real-time slot synchronization
* availability tracking
* schedule conflict prevention

----

# 🔐 Doctor Authentication & Access Control System

Secure doctor login and onboarding workflow implemented through:


auth_store.py

doctor_config.py


Includes:

* role-based authentication
* secure credential handling
* onboarding interface
* protected dashboard access

----

# 📊 Doctor Dashboard Interface

Doctor interaction dashboard built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Located inside:


static/


Includes:


doc_dashboard.html
doc_login.html

* doctor authentication
* onboarding workflow
* voice dashboard interface
* scheduling visualization

----

# 🗂️ Database Architecture

Structured appointment and patient data storage implemented using SQLAlchemy ORM.

Located inside:


db/database.py
db/models.py
db/repository.py
schema.py


Supports:

* appointment tracking
* patient records
* doctor configuration storage
* scheduling analytics support

----
